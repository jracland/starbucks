Starbucks Rewards Page

I completed this project gradually over January 2022. It was my first fully independent project after learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5 by building a couple of pages following tutorials. At this point, I had 2 months of experience learning these skills part-time during the nights after my kids went to bed. I managed to get roughly 1-2 hours of practice each night, 3-4 nights a week.

My task was to replicate the Starbucks Rewards page, found here: https://www.starbucks.com/rewards

The task was set by frontendpractice.com, found here: https://www.frontendpractice.com/project/starbucks

I first added all the content using HTML and Bootstrap (roughly 8 hours including researching to gain new skills and refresh prefiously used skills). I then added media queries to replicate the responsiveness of the original page. I then styled the page to match the original page.

Over the course of this project, I gained more experience in:

- HTML markup
- Layout (using Bootstrap 5)
- Bootstrap 5 Navbars, containers, columns, hero images
- Styling (using CSS)
- Using media queries for responsive styling
- Using Git and VSCode for version control

New skills I learned were:

- Making a navbar sticky
- Making a tabbed section
- Making a horizontal list
- Making an accordion
- Using media queries with display:none to change elements at different break points (i.e the button on the banner and the accordion switching to columns).
- Taking a 'mobile first' approach to web development
